# R_GUI_Automation

With this R GUI, using the libraries "gwidget2" and "KeyboardSimulator", I could replicate one of my daily tasks at work. Basically this GUI moves the mouse and press some keys upon request. You can update it as you need. Hope you find this useful, do not hesitate to contact me if there are any doubts!
